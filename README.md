    "proposal_document": "# Project Specification Document: Chatbot (Basic Complexity)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\nThis document outlines the specifications for developing a basic chatbot using Python. The project aims to deliver a functional chatbot that can engage with users through text-based interactions. Key insights include leveraging Python's capabilities to create a scalable and reliable solution with a focus on user experience. The project is estimated to require the development of approximately 3900 equivalent lines of code.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Project Overview\n\n### Purpose\nThe purpose of this project is to develop a basic chatbot that can simulate conversation with users, providing quick and efficient responses to predefined queries.\n\n### Background\nWith the increasing demand for automated customer service solutions, chatbots have become essential tools in improving user engagement and operational efficiency.\n\n### Goals\n- Develop a fully functional text-based chatbot.\n- Ensure ease of integration with existing platforms.\n- Provide accurate and timely responses to user inputs.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Functional Requirements\n\n1. **User Interaction**: \n   - Receive and process user inputs in real-time.\n   - Provide appropriate responses based on predefined logic.\n\n2. **Predefined Responses**:\n   - Implement a set of predefined responses for common queries.\n   - Support for updating and expanding the response database.\n\n3. **Basic NLP Integration**:\n   - Basic Natural Language Processing capabilities for understanding user intent.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Gracefully handle unrecognized inputs with default responses or error messages.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- **Performance**: \n  - The system should be able to handle up to 100 concurrent users with minimal latency.\n  \n- **Scalability**: \n  - Design should allow future enhancements and scalability without major restructuring.\n  \n- **Reliability**: \n  - Ensure a high availability rate, aiming for 99% uptime during operation hours.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Technical Architecture\n\n### System Diagrams\n- A simple client-server architecture where the client (user interface) communicates with the server (chatbot processing engine).\n\n### Services\n- User Interface Service: Handles input/output with users.\n- Processing Engine: Processes input using basic NLP and retrieves appropriate responses from the database.\n\n### Technology Stack\n- Programming Language: Python\n\n---\n\n## 6. Development Estimation\n\nBased on COCOMO-II estimation:\n- Equivalent SLOC (with reuse): 3900 lines\n- Estimated Effort, Development Time, and Team Size are not available but will be adjusted based on further detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Risk Assessment\n\n### Potential Risks:\n1. **Inaccurate Responses**:\n   - Mitigation: Continuous testing and updating of response logic.\n\n2. **Scalability Challenges**:\n   - Mitigation: Use modular design principles allowing easy scaling.\n\n3. **Integration Issues**:\n   - Mitigation: Develop comprehensive API documentation and integration guides.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Deliverables & Milestones\n\n1. **Phase 1: Planning & Requirement Analysis**\n   - Deliverable: Requirement Specification Document\n   - Timeline: Month 1\n  \n2. **Phase 2: Development**\n   - Deliverable: Initial Version of Chatbot\n   - Timeline: Months 2-3\n  \n3. **Phase 3: Testing & Evaluation**\n   - Deliverable: Test Report and Finalized Chatbot\n   - Timeline: Month 4\n  \n4. **Phase 4: Deployment & Training**\n   - Deliverable: Deployed Solution and User Training Materials\n   - Timeline: Month 5\n\n---\n\n## 9. Acceptance Criteria\n\nThe project will be considered complete when:\n- The chatbot consistently provides accurate responses as per predefined scenarios.\n- Performance metrics are met, including concurrency handling and uptime requirements.\n- Successful integration with designated platforms without major issues.\n  \nQuality benchmarks include meeting all functional requirements without major defects post-deployment.\n\n---\n\n## 10.
