  "document": "# SmartEdu LMS Project Specification Document\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\nThe SmartEdu LMS project aims to develop a comprehensive learning management system tailored for educational institutions, designed to enhance learning experiences through interactive modules and seamless administration. The project has an intermediate complexity level, requiring a dedicated team to deliver key features such as user authentication, course modules with quizzes, progress tracking, live video conferencing, and an admin dashboard.\n\n## 2. Project Overview\n\n### Purpose\nThe purpose of the SmartEdu LMS is to provide an efficient platform for managing educational content and facilitating interactive learning experiences for students and teachers.\n\n### Background\nWith the increasing demand for digital education solutions, SmartEdu LMS intends to offer a robust platform that addresses key challenges faced by educators, including content management, student engagement, and performance tracking.\n\n### Goals\n- Develop a user-friendly LMS with essential features for both learners and educators.\n- Integrate advanced tools such as live video conferencing to support remote learning.\n- Provide analytics and progress tracking to improve learning outcomes.\n\n## 3. Functional Requirements\n\n### User Authentication and Role Management\n- Secure login system with roles: Administrator, Instructor, Student.\n- Password recovery and two-factor authentication.\n\n### Interactive Course Modules with Quizzes\n- Creation of multimedia-rich courses by instructors.\n- Self-paced learning with embedded quizzes for assessment.\n\n### Progress Tracking and Analytics\n- Dashboard displaying individual progress reports.\n- Analytics on course completion rates and student performance.\n\n### Live Video Conferencing Integration\n- Real-time video classes using third-party integration (e.g., Zoom or Microsoft Teams).\n- Recording sessions for later review.\n\n### Admin Dashboard for Content Management\n- Manage courses, users, assessments.\n- Generate reports on platform usage statistics.\n\n## 4. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Performance\n- System response time should be under 2 seconds for any action.\n  \n### Scalability\n- Support up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.\n\n### Reliability\n- System uptime should be at least 99.5%.\n\n## 5. Technical Architecture\n\n### System Diagrams\n![System Architecture Diagram](link_to_diagram)\n\n### Services\n- Authentication Service: Manages user roles and access control.\n- Course Management Service: Handles course creation and updates.\n- Analytics Service: Aggregates data for reporting purposes.\n  \n### Tech Stack\n- Frontend: React.js\n- Backend: Node.js with Express.js\n- Database: PostgreSQL\n- Video Conferencing: Integration via Zoom API/Microsoft Teams API\n\n## 6. Development Estimation\n\nBased on COCOMO-II estimation:\n\n| Metric | Estimate |\n|--------|----------|\n| Estimated SLOC | 18,000 |\n| Equivalent SLOC (with reuse) | 14,500 |\n| Total SLOC (after REVL) | 16,000 |\n| Estimated Effort | 24.5 person-months |\n| Development Time | 5.5 months |\n| Average Team Size | 4.45 members |\n\n## 7. Risk Assessment\n\n**Project Risks**\n1. **Integration Failure**: Potential issues in integrating third-party video conferencing tools.\n   - *Mitigation*: Conduct thorough testing in early stages; have backup solutions ready.\n\n2. **Data Security**: Risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n   - *Mitigation*: Implement robust encryption protocols; regular security audits.\n\n3. **Scope Creep**: Addition of requirements beyond initial scope can delay the project.\n   - *Mitigation*: Establish clear project scope; adhere strictly unless changes are critical.\n\n## 8. Deliverables & Milestones\n\n**Phases**\n\n1. **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering & Design (Month 1)\n   - Deliverable: Requirements Specification Document\n  \n2. **Phase 2**: Development (Months 2 - 4)\n   - Deliverable: Beta Release\n  \n3. **Phase 3**: Testing & Integration (Month 4 - Month 5"
